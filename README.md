SimpleRelevance-Python
======================

a simple Python wrapper for the SimpleRelevance api (simplerelevance.com). 
Instructions are in the file, and further documentation is available at simplerelevance.com/docs/api2.
This file does not include usage examples or tests, but I promise it's very simple. It works using python-requests.
